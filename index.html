          Mechanic to a Software Devloper. I used to have a Ecommerce Business
          selling performance car parts and accessories when I got a taste of
          web development. After that and the state of the Automotive Industry I
          decided to switch careers.</span

          associate to managing the biggest vaporizer franchise in my home town.
          I have honed my people skills to not just help the company make money

        <h1>Mechanic</h1>
        <span class="mechanic-summary">
          I have always had a passion for cars. Escpecially racecars. Since I
          love working with my hand and building things I decided to go to
          school to become a mechanic gaining certificates for multiple
          automotive companies such as Subaru, Ford, Toyota; etc. I fell in love
          with all the racecars I've built but with the development of EV's and
          government mandates I knew it was time for a career switch.

        <span class="programmer-summary">
          Now as a programmer I found a career where I can build, like I did as
          a mechanic, amazing applications and websites that could help others,
          like I did in retail. So far as a Software Developer I've been
          enjoying building different apps and even video games with all these
          programming languages. So far I feel like this is the career for me.
